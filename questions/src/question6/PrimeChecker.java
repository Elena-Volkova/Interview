 * A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
 * Given p integers, determine the primality of each integer and print whether it is Prime or Not prime on a new line.
 *
 * Note: If possible, try to come up with an O(âˆšn) primality algorithm.
 *
 * Test:
 * 3
 * 12
 * 5
 * 7
 *
 * Result:
 * Not prime
 * Prime
 * Prime
